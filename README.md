# JumpKeysWinForms
JumpKeys is a .Net framework designed to improve keyboard navigation for Windows Forms .Net7 and above.
Its goal is to make desktop applications more accessible for people unable to use mouse for UI navigation. 
Also, for any user who prefers active use of keyboard. 

It provides developers with ready to use and customizable navigation options for WinForms controls.

Unlike default Tab implementation which bavigates at controls' level with TabIndex and TabOrder, 
it provides ability to navigate inside controls between various elements. 

Register JumpKeys navigations by single line of code after form construction:

1. Using JumpKeys
2. NavigationBulder.Control(ControlName).Register();
3. It's done.
